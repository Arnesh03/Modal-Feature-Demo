# Modal-Feature-Demo

A modal is a dialog box/pop-up window that is displayed on top of the current page. It is a type of user interface component that is used to display content in a pop-up window, with the main page being obscured behind it.

In this modal feature demo webpage, there are three buttons that when clicked, trigger the display of a modal window. The modal can be closed by clicking on the overlay (the area outside of the modal window), pressing the ESC button on the keyboard, or by clicking on the 'X' button located on the top of the modal window.

The modal provides a way for the user to interact with specific content without leaving the main page. This can be useful for displaying additional information, form inputs, or for making selections without navigating away from the main page.

The modal feature on this demo webpage provides a functional and user-friendly way for users to interact with content and make selections
